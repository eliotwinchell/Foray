# EV Compass 
(Formerly Foray)

**_Project Description:_** 

We have designed an iOS app to help electric vehicle (EV) drivers plan their travel with peace of mind. Our solution displays charging stations in the vicinity of the user on a map allowing them to plan routes that meet their vehicles charging needs along the way. This product addresses a key market need for progression to widespread use of EV's which will be instrumental in lowering carbon emissions worldwide.

**_Motivation_**

This functionality is only availble to users of certain EVs, in particular Tesla users, and even then the driver must use the car's onboard system to plan their route. It is believed that the availbility of a mobile app capable of integrating trip planning with EV charigning needs would foment the adoption of EVs as this functionality reduces user's range anxiety associated with the relative scaraciuty of charinging options compared to the availbity of petroleum fuels.

* MongoDB
* Mongoose
